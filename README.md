# Neural-Network-Implementation
This implementation of neural networks takes scholarly articles in the field of Cognitive Psychology and classifies them into a category.

There are two different types of neural network implementations included in this repository:
1) Semi-supervised learning via a Perceptron with backpropogation. To test the Perceptron, simply run the file "Final.m".
2) Unsupervised learning via a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of various lattice sizes. To test the SOM, run the file "SOMFinal.m".
